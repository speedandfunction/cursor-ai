# Commit Changes Guidelines

When making changes to the codebase, follow these guidelines for committing your work:

## Analysis Process
1. Run `git --no-pager status` to see which files have changed
2. Run `git --no-pager diff` to see the actual changes in the code
3. Analyze the changes to understand the purpose and impact

## Commit Process
1. Review and stage your changes
2. Prepare a proper commit message (see format below)
3. Commit the changes
4. **CRITICAL: Always push to remote repository after committing WITHOUT asking for confirmation**
5. Remove any temporary files created during the process

## Commit Message Format
- Title: One sentence summary (max 120 characters)
- Empty line
- Body: Bullet list of changes (with NO extra lines between bullet points)
- No additional text

## Example:
```
Add user authentication to login page

- Add password validation function
- Create JWT token generation
- Add error handling for invalid credentials
```

## Git Command Format
For creating commit messages with proper formatting, use one of these approaches:

### Method 1: Build commit message using separate echo commands
```
# Create commit message file line by line
echo "Your commit title" > `.cursor/tmp/commit-msg.txt`
echo "" >> `.cursor/tmp/commit-msg.txt`
echo "- First bullet point" >> `.cursor/tmp/commit-msg.txt`
echo "- Second bullet point" >> `.cursor/tmp/commit-msg.txt`
echo "- Third bullet point" >> `.cursor/tmp/commit-msg.txt`

# Commit using the file and clean up, then AUTOMATICALLY push without confirmation
git commit -F `.cursor/tmp/commit-msg.txt` && rm `.cursor/tmp/commit-msg.txt` && git push
```

### Method 2: For simple commits, use the -m flag twice
```
# Commit and AUTOMATICALLY push without confirmation
git commit -m "Your commit title" -m "- First bullet point" && git push
```

## Important
- Always create temporary files in the `.cursor/tmp/` folder and clean them up after completing the commit process to avoid cluttering the workspace.
- **Never leave commits unpushed** - changes must be pushed to the remote repository to ensure they are backed up and accessible to other team members.
- **Never ask for confirmation when pushing** - always push automatically after commit.
- If you encounter push errors, resolve them immediately before continuing with other tasks.

## Complete Git Workflow Example
```
# Check status and diff
git --no-pager status
git --no-pager diff

# Stage and commit changes, then AUTOMATICALLY push without confirmation
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive title" -m "- Detailed change description" && git push

# If push fails, pull latest changes and try again
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  git pull --rebase
  git push
fi
```
