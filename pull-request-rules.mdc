# Pull Request Guidelines

When creating or updating a pull request, follow these guidelines:

## Analysis Process
1. Run `git --no-pager status` to see which files have changed
2. Run `git --no-pager diff` to compare the current branch with origin default branch
3. Analyze the changes to understand the purpose and impact

## Pull Request Types

- `fix`: Patches a bug in your codebase (correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning)
- `feat`: Introduces a new feature to the codebase (correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning)
- `BREAKING CHANGE`: Introduces a breaking API change (correlates with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning)
- Other allowed types: `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`

## Specification Details

1. Title MUST be prefixed with a type, followed by an OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL !, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space
2. The type `feat` MUST be used when adding a new feature
3. The type `fix` MUST be used when fixing a bug
4. A scope MAY be provided after a type, surrounded by parenthesis (e.g., `fix(parser):`)

## Pull Request Format
- Title: One sentence summary (max 120 characters)
- Body: 
  - Bullet list of changes (with NO extra lines between bullet points)
  - After the list, add a brief explanation of why this PR is needed
- Do NOT repeat the title in the body

## Example:
```
feat: Add user authentication to login page

Body:
- Add password validation function
- Create JWT token generation
- Add error handling for invalid credentials

This feature is necessary to secure user accounts and prevent unauthorized access to the application.
```

## PR Description Formatting
When creating a PR, ensure that:
- The title is not repeated in the body
- All bullet points are written without extra lines between them
- The body starts directly with bullet points (no introductory text)
- When using GitHub CLI, use `--body-file` instead of `--body` to avoid escape character issues
- Always create the PR body file in the `/tmp/` folder (e.g., `/tmp/pr-body.md`)
In GitHub or similar platforms, preview the PR description to verify there are no unwanted
line breaks between bullet points.

## Process
1. Analyze changes between origin default branch and current branch
2. Create PR title and bullet list description
3. Create new PR or update existing PR tied to current branch
4. Request review if needed
