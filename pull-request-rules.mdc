# Pull Request Guidelines

When creating or updating a pull request, follow these guidelines:

## Analysis Process
1. Run `git --no-pager status` to see which files have changed
2. Run `git --no-pager diff` to compare the current branch with origin default branch
3. Analyze the changes to understand the purpose and impact
4. Check `memory-bank/tasks.md` and `memory-bank/activeContext.md` for GitHub issue references

## GitHub Issue Integration
1. **Issue Reference Detection**: Look for issue references in the following format:
   - `**Issue Reference**: [#<number>](https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/<number>)` (in memory bank files)
   - Search both `memory-bank/tasks.md` and `memory-bank/activeContext.md` files
2. **Issue Link in PR Body**: If an issue reference is found, include it in the PR body:
   - Check if the issue link is already mentioned in the PR body
   - If not mentioned, add "**Related Issue**: #<number>: <issue_title>" after the bullet list
   - If already mentioned, update the existing issue link to ensure it's current and correctly formatted with title
3. **Issue Update After PR**: After creating or updating the PR, update the related issue:
   - Check if the PR link is already mentioned in the issue body
   - If not mentioned, update the issue body to include the PR link: "**Related PR**: #<pr_number>: <pr_title>"
   - If already mentioned, update the existing PR link to ensure it's current and correctly formatted with title
   - Use appropriate labels if the PR addresses/closes the issue

## Pull Request Types

- `fix`: Patches a bug in your codebase (correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning)
- `feat`: Introduces a new feature to the codebase (correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning)
- `BREAKING CHANGE`: Introduces a breaking API change (correlates with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning)
- Other allowed types: `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`

## Specification Details

1. Title MUST be prefixed with a type, followed by an OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL !, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space
2. The type `feat` MUST be used when adding a new feature
3. The type `fix` MUST be used when fixing a bug
4. A scope MAY be provided after a type, surrounded by parenthesis (e.g., `fix(parser):`)

## Pull Request Format
- Title: One sentence summary (max 120 characters)
- Body: 
  - Bullet list of changes (with NO extra lines between bullet points)
  - **Related Issue**: #<number>: <issue_title> (if issue reference found - update existing link or add new one)
  - After the list, add a brief explanation of why this PR is needed
- Do NOT repeat the title in the body

## Example with Issue Reference (new or updated):
```
feat: Add user authentication to login page

Body:
- Add password validation function
- Create JWT token generation
- Add error handling for invalid credentials

**Related Issue**: #37: GitHub Reader Step Implementation

This feature is necessary to secure user accounts and prevent unauthorized access to the application.
```

## Example without Issue Reference:
```
feat: Add user authentication to login page

Body:
- Add password validation function
- Create JWT token generation
- Add error handling for invalid credentials

This feature is necessary to secure user accounts and prevent unauthorized access to the application.
```

## PR Description Formatting
When creating a PR, ensure that:
- The title is not repeated in the body
- All bullet points are written without extra lines between them
- The body starts directly with bullet points (no introductory text)
- Check if issue reference already exists in PR body, then update existing link or add new one if found in Memory Bank files
- When using GitHub CLI, use `--body-file` instead of `--body` to avoid escape character issues
- Always create the PR body file in the `.cursor/tmp/` folder (e.g., `.cursor/tmp/pr-body.md`)
In GitHub or similar platforms, preview the PR description to verify there are no unwanted
line breaks between bullet points.

## Process
1. Analyze changes between origin default branch and current branch
2. Check Memory Bank files for issue references
3. Create PR title and bullet list description
4. Check if issue reference already exists in PR body, then update existing link or add new one
5. Create new PR or update existing PR tied to current branch
6. **Post-PR Actions**: If issue reference was found:
   - Check if the PR link is already mentioned in the issue body
   - If not mentioned, update the issue body to include the PR link with title
   - If already mentioned, update the existing PR link to ensure it's current and correctly formatted with title
   - Apply appropriate labels (e.g., "in-progress", "has-pr")
   - Update issue status if appropriate
7. Request review if needed
